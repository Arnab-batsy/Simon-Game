# Simon-Game
Hello developers! 
This repo contains all the code files and assets of Simon game.
Simon game is a simple game of short-term memory skill originally invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison, working for toy design firm Marvin Glass and Associates, 
with software programming by Lenny Cope. The device creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence.

The game is of lights and sounds in which players must repeat random sequences of lights by pressing the colored pads in the correct order. 
It's fast-paced play, with lights and sounds that can challenge you. Experience the fun as you repeat the patterns and advance to higher levels. 
Keep track of your score as you challenge friends or try to beat your own high score. 

I created the logic of the game using simple javaScript and jQuery.
The UI is created using HTML and CSS.
I hope you enjoy the game.
