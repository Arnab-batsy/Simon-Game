# Simon-Game
Hello developers! 
This repo contains all the code files and assets of Simon game.
Simon game is a simple game of short-term memory skill originally invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison, working for toy design firm Marvin Glass and Associates, 
with software programming by Lenny Cope. The device creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence.

In the game, players must repeat random sequences of lights by pressing the colored pads in the correct order. 
It's fast-paced play, with lights and sounds that can challenge you. Experience the fun as you repeat the patterns and advance to higher levels. 
Keep track of your score as you challenge friends or try to beat your own high score. 

How to Play!
- Press any key on your keyboard to start the game.
- Among the four coloured buttons (Red, Blue, Green and Yellow), one will flash.
- Click that button and remember it!
- Once you've clicked, the next sequence will begin and you'll see another button flash. The level increases from 1 to 2.
- Now you've to click two buttons- First the button that you've already clicked last time and remembered it. Second the new button that flashed.
- If you succeed, the level will increase from 2 to 3. Another new button will flash.
- Now you've to click three buttons in a row- The last 2 buttons that you already clicked and the new button that flashed.
- If you succeed, the level will keep on increasing and you've to repeat the same steps to keep winning.
- The sequence may not be same everytime. It's random. The key to winning is remembering the correct order of buttons that flashed.
- If you click a wrong button, you lose. Press any key to restart the game!

I created the logic of the game using simple javaScript and jQuery.
The UI is created using HTML and CSS.
I hope you enjoy the game.
